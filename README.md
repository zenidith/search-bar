A small search bar project in order to learn keystroke events with JavaScript. In this exercise I have covered: 
- how to use `event.target.value`
- how to use addEventListener
- how to use toLowerCase()
- also how to use `.includes` method, which allows us to compare data between 2 strings (the search input as well as the textContent of `#id="names"`

To see and test the project live, please follow this [link](https://zenidith.github.io/search-bar/)

Happy Coding!
